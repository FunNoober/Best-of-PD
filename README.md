# Best-of-PD
Best of PD is a tempory name for this project. This project is the ultimate first person police simulation game (or it hopes to be one day). The player will be able to repsond to calls and each call will use a template then modify that template to make each playthrough truly unique. The player is expected to detain civilians, bring in suspects, and prevent the situation from escalting. The player will be able to customize their kit and will have access to certain equipment depending on the call they go on.

## Development
This project was originally going to be an unnamed SWAT simulation game in the style of games like "SWAT 4" or "Ready or Not", however, I have decided to make a vision switch and make something that is truly unique and original.
